This is my version of a JavaScript Neighborhood Map for Project 6 of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001).

This project provided experience with ...

**Associated Udacity courses include:**

* [Intro to AJAX](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud110-nd)
* [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud989-nd)

**Goal of the Project:**

* To develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. 
* Add a full-screen map using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
* Add map markers identifying a number of locations your are interested in within this neighborhood.
* Implement a list view of the identified locations.
* Implement a search bar functionality to search and filter your existing map markers. 
* Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked.  
* To utilize the [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) framework to manage the project complexity.
* Learn how to use design patterns to assist in developing a manageable codebase.
* Learn how to implement third-party API/'s valuable data sets to improve the quality of your application.

**Bonus:**

* ...

###Viewing the Map:

To view the map, clone it from my github account:

```
git clone https://github.com/benplant/neighborhood-map.git
```

and then open index.html in your browser.

###Results:

* I went with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for the build system on this project.  I have used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) on other projects and wanted to diversify my experience.
